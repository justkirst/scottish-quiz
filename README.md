# Scottish Quiz Game

## Introduction

The Scottish Quiz game is a fun way for people to test their knowledge on fun Scottish trivia. The site is targeted at users who have an interest in unique parts of Scottish culture. This quiz suits this demographic as it has different sections based on culture, slang, media and a little bit of general knowledge too.

## Planning Stages

### Site Aims

- To create a fun game for people to test their knowledge on Scottish trivia.
- The questions and answers to be in a grid that resembles a playing card. I tried to achieve this by creating a grid that was a similar shape and size to one.
  
### Technologies Used

- HTML for the main structure of the website
- CSS to create the design aspects of the quiz
- JavaScript for the interactivity of the quiz and for the improved user experience of the quiz.

### Testing

## Manual Testing

During the build of the repository, I manually checked the website throughout on my large desktop computer, laptop and mobile phone to make sure the look and feel of the website was correct. I also used Chrome Dev Tools to see how the website would look on different sizes also.

## Post Deployment Testing

After developing the website, I used validation tools to highlight any performance issues.
